# Emojify
About :
In this Project Emojify I have created a model which will predict an emoji based on my live expressions. This project is purely based on CNN and Computer Vision. For this project I have created my own dataset and then trained my model with that dataset. I mainly considered five emotions (i.e. Angry, Happy, Sad, Neutral and Shock)

Tools Required :
Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab, Webcam

Language Used :
Python 3.7.6

Methodologies :
Transfer Learning, CNN, Haar Cascade Classifier, Computer Vision

Explaining Some Files :

1.	Own_Face_Dataset :- This contains the dataset of my own face you can also create the dataset in the same manner by using facedata.ipynb code.

2.	Raw Emoji :- It contains the emoji downloaded directly from google you have to resize them using Resize_Emoji.ipynb code to use them for masking.

3.	Emoji :- Here I have saved the resized emojis.
